# MPE v1.1 Slim — 10-Market Backtest Validation Report

*Phase 6.5.2 · generated 2026-04-27 · 12-week holdout · MAPE thresholds: Brand <22%, Total <25%*

## Method

For each market: use the last 12 weeks of `ps.v_weekly` as holdout. Project using the Frequentist baseline (last-8-week mean of training window, separately per component). Regime-crossings within the holdout window are flagged since they disturb the baseline assumption and carry larger MAPE.

## Aggregate

- Markets with Brand MAPE < 22%: **8/10** (gate: ≥8/10)
- Markets with Total MAPE < 25%: **8/10**
- Overall acceptance: **PASS** (Phase 6.5.2 gate)

## Interpretation

The Frequentist baseline is a conservative lower bound on what the full engine delivers (adding the regime stream typically improves MAPE for markets with active structural lifts). Markets failing the gate are usually:
- **Regime-crossing in the holdout window** — a step-change occurred during the   period being predicted; the baseline can't anticipate this.
- **Small-sample markets** (AU, JP) — limited weekly history makes any 8w mean noisy.
- **Campaign-heavy markets** (MX post-Sparkle) — recent Sparkle lift (W15 step from ~200   to ~400 Brand regs) creates a discontinuity the baseline smooths away.

The production engine improves on this by: (1) applying the regime stream with decay, (2) normalizing the anchor at the latest YTD week, (3) allowing the user to select scenario chips (Bayesian / Frequentist / Mixed / No lift).
