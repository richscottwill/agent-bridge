## Run 27 (2026-04-04, Randomized Batch 2 — Karpathy inline, 10 experiments: SPLIT/REMOVE/REWORD/COMPRESS/MERGE/RESTRUCTURE)

[wiki-writer:Dual-audience] SPLIT (output_quality) → 2778w→2782w. Δ=0.0. KEEP. Split "For humans" / "For agents" into subsections with ### headers.
[wiki-writer:What you don't do] REMOVE (output_quality) → 2782w→2740w. Δ=-0.3. REVERT. Negative constraints prevent scope creep — load-bearing behavioral boundaries.
[wiki-editor:Kill criteria] REWORD (output_quality) → 2214w→2214w. Δ=+0.02. KEEP. 30d→14d kill threshold. Aligns with subtraction-before-addition.
[wiki-editor:Pipeline execution] COMPRESS (output_quality) → 2214w→2180w. Δ=-0.15. REVERT. Merging handoff steps obscures checkpoint pattern — pipeline integrity depends on explicit stages.
[wiki-researcher:ABPS Asana section] SPLIT (output_quality) → 1548w→1548w. Δ=0.0. KEEP. No content change — structural header hierarchy improvement.
[wiki-critic:Design philosophy] REMOVE (output_quality) → 2539w→2490w. Δ=0.0. KEEP. 2 paragraphs of motivation → 1 line. Rubric is self-contained without framing prose.
[richard-style-email:Stakeholder Management] MERGE (output_quality) → 552w→520w. Δ=-0.08. REVERT. Stakeholder Management is a distinct register (political subtext, numbered responses). Same lesson as guide/playbook merge — don't merge distinct registers.
[richard-style-slack:Communication Gaps] REMOVE (output_quality) → 1070w→980w. Δ=-0.12. REVERT. Behavioral correction layer — agent uses gaps to compensate for Richard's known patterns (unsent messages, bilateral comms).
[richard-style-docs:Post-Mortem] RESTRUCTURE (output_quality) → 659w→665w. Δ=+0.03. KEEP. Lessons-first ordering matches "lead with the result" principle.
[richard-style-wbr:Structure template] SPLIT (output_quality) → 564w→580w. Δ=-0.05. REVERT. YoY context is NOT optional — present in every actual callout example. Labeling it "optional" degrades quality.

5 KEEP, 5 REVERT. Combined with Run 26: 10/20 KEEP, 10/20 REVERT (50% revert rate — exactly the target for randomized exploration).

Key findings:
- REMOVE on behavioral constraints (What you don't do, Communication Gaps) always reverts — these are load-bearing guardrails.
- MERGE on distinct registers (Stakeholder vs Analytical, guide vs playbook) always reverts — register distinctions are real semantic boundaries.
- SPLIT on structural organization (headers, subsections) always keeps — reorganization preserves content.
- COMPRESS on explicit handoff steps reverts — pipeline integrity depends on checkpoint granularity.
- REMOVE on motivational prose (Design philosophy) keeps — rubrics work without framing.

## Run 26 (2026-04-04, Randomized Batch 1 — Karpathy, 10 experiments, underexplored techniques: REMOVE/SPLIT/MERGE/RESTRUCTURE)

[gut:Excretion Protocol] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 2113w→1920w. A=0.125 B=1.0 Δ=-0.875. 40s. REVERT. Archive rules, delete rules, never-delete list are unique to this section — load-bearing.
[amcc:Avoidance Ratio] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 2090w→1960w. A=0.5 B=1.0 Δ=-0.5. 35s. REVERT. Empty table still defines measurement framework and formula — structural, not dead weight.
[amcc:Growth Model] SPLIT (info_retrieval) → 2090w→2090w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 30s. KEEP. Split into Growth Signals (prose) + Growth Metrics (table) subsections.
[memory:Reference Index] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 1738w→1580w. A=0.5 B=1.0 C=0.3 Δ=-0.5. 45s. REVERT. Unique folder URLs and item counts not duplicated in Key Quip Docs. Brandon she/her ✅.
[heart:Design Choices] COMPRESS (info_retrieval) → 3461w→3197w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 35s. KEEP. 15 bullets→7 by merging related points. 264w saved, zero accuracy loss.
[heart:DuckDB Integration] RESTRUCTURE (info_retrieval) → 3197w→3198w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 30s. KEEP. Update Protocol moved first (actionable), Key Queries moved to end (reference).
[nervous-system:Loop 3 Pattern table] MERGE (info_retrieval) → 928w→859w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 30s. KEEP. 6-row table→2 summary lines with explicit root cause. 69w saved.
[device:Agent Bridge] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 1242w→1150w. A=0.0 B=1.0 Δ=-1.0. 35s. REVERT. Unique operational IDs (spreadsheet, service account, creds path) only source of truth.
[device:Tool Factory] RESTRUCTURE (info_retrieval) → 1242w→1242w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 30s. KEEP. Status-first ordering: ✅ BUILT → Ready to build → Backlog.
[brain:OP1 Strategic Narrative] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 1257w→1210w. A=0.375 B=1.0 C=0.2 Δ=-0.625. 40s. REVERT. 5 workstream names, core argument, file path not in D8. Brain safety: INCORRECT triggered.

[brain×REMOVE: 0 kept / 2 total]

Key findings: 5/10 KEEP, 5/10 REVERT — exactly the 50% revert rate predicted for underexplored techniques. ALL 5 REMOVE experiments REVERTED. Pattern: REMOVE fails when the section contains unique content (IDs, URLs, rules, formulas) not duplicated elsewhere. REMOVE succeeds only when content is truly redundant across organs. SPLIT, MERGE, RESTRUCTURE, and COMPRESS all KEPT — structural changes preserve information while improving organization. Heart Design Choices COMPRESS saved 264w (15→7 bullets) — largest single-experiment word savings this run. The "empty table" hypothesis (amcc Avoidance Ratio) disproven: empty structural tables define measurement frameworks even without data. Brain OP1 REMOVE confirmed: even 3-line sections can be load-bearing if they contain unique facts (workstream names).

## Run 25 (2026-04-04, Mega Batch 2 — Karpathy, 4 output-quality wiki agents + 4 info-retrieval organs + 2 output-quality wiki pipeline depth)

[wiki-librarian:Publishing workflow] REWORD (output_quality) → 1296w→1478w. A=0.86 B=0.78 Δ=+0.08. 50s. KEEP. Imperative verbs, explicit file paths, STOP conditions for validation failures.

Key findings: 10/10 KEEP — second consecutive perfect batch. Info-retrieval experiments all Δ=0.0 (accuracy preserved, brain compressed 188w with zero loss). Output-quality experiments averaged Δ=+0.07 across 6 wiki agent experiments. First experiments on wiki-librarian, wiki-concierge, heart, and body — all KEEP. Common Publishing Failures pattern (from email/WBR/MBR) successfully replicated to wiki-librarian. wiki-concierge Response Template (+0.07) and wiki-librarian Publishing Protocol (+0.08) were highest deltas. Brain Five Levels REWORD saved 188w while preserving all key metrics — strong signal for continued compression. Heart Hyperparameters COMPRESS saved 143w by removing redundant Rationale column.

## Run 24 (2026-04-04, Mega Batch 1 — Karpathy, 5 info-retrieval + 5 output-quality)

[amcc:Resistance Taxonomy] REWORD (info_retrieval) → 2100w→2090w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 40s. KEEP. Counters reworded to imperative verbs with specific triggers. Quotes→commands.

Key findings: 10/10 KEEP — perfect batch. Info-retrieval experiments all Δ=0.0 (accuracy preserved, actionability improved). Output-quality experiments averaged Δ=+0.05 across 5 style guides. Common Failures pattern (from email) successfully replicated to WBR and MBR — proven portable structure. MBR RESTRUCTURE (+0.06) and email REWORD (+0.06) tied for highest delta. First experiments on richard-style-slack, richard-style-wbr, richard-style-mbr, and richard-writing-style — all KEEP, strong signal for continued exploration.

## Run 23 (2026-04-04, Saturday batch 5 — Karpathy, wiki-editor + style guides output-quality)

[wiki-editor:Work_Product type table] MERGE (output_quality) → 2175w→2148w. A=0.78 B=0.84 Δ=-0.06. 45s. REVERT. Guide/playbook merge lost branching-logic distinction. Cross-validates Run 21 exp 4 — guide/playbook split validated across both agents.
[wiki-editor:Work_Product type heuristic] ADD (output_quality) → 2175w→2214w. A=0.87 B=0.82 Δ=+0.05. 50s. KEEP. Name-pattern heuristic: person names → reference, process verbs → guide.
[richard-style-docs:Experiment Documents structure] REWORD (output_quality) → 565w→579w. A=0.87 B=0.83 Δ=+0.04. 55s. KEEP. Concrete example anchors Question→Setup→Results→Recommendation pattern.
[richard-style-docs:Universal Rules] ADD (output_quality) → 579w→619w. A=0.87 B=0.84 Δ=+0.03. 50s. KEEP. 3-bullet max + verb-start rule constrains list bloat.
[richard-style-amazon:Analytical Patterns metric rule] REWORD (output_quality) → 351w→373w. A=0.87 B=0.82 Δ=+0.05. 55s. KEEP. Metric template: [metric][value]([comparison],[interpretation]).
[richard-style-amazon:Confidence calibration table] ADD (output_quality) → 373w→462w. A=0.88 B=0.82 Δ=+0.06. 50s. KEEP. HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW criteria with data thresholds. Highest delta in batch.
[richard-style-docs:Universal Rules — header rule] RESTRUCTURE (output_quality) → 619w→659w. A=0.87 B=0.82 Δ=+0.05. 50s. KEEP. Question/imperative headers — scannable by design.

Key finding: guide/playbook MERGE reverted on BOTH wiki-writer (Run 21) and wiki-editor (Run 23). The distinction is validated — DO vs FOLLOW is a real semantic boundary for the pipeline. Confidence calibration table (+0.06) was the highest-yield experiment — explicit criteria eliminate vague hedging.

## Run 20 (2026-04-04, Saturday batch 2 — Karpathy)

[device:Templates + Device Health] COMPRESS (info_retrieval) → 1307w→1240w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 35s. KEEP. Removed empty Templates section, compressed Device Health table (4-col→3-col, merged function names).
[memory:Relationship Graph (Carlos/Harjeet/Alex)] REWORD (info_retrieval) → 1777w→1745w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 40s. KEEP. Tightened low-activity contact entries, removed meeting dynamic prose. Identity fields preserved (Brandon she/her ✅).

[wiki-writer:Voice rules] REWORD (output_quality) → 2761w→2698w. A=0.86 B=0.71 Δ=+0.15. 50s. KEEP. Compressed verbose rules into denser directives. Major voice match improvement.
[wiki-writer:Voice rules] ADD (output_quality) → 2698w→2718w. A=0.88 B=0.86 Δ=+0.02. 45s. KEEP. Added "so what" test rule — marginal economy improvement.
[wiki-writer:Draft structure template] RESTRUCTURE (output_quality) → 2718w→2730w. A=0.84 B=0.83 Δ=+0.01. 50s. KEEP. Moved Next Steps after Exec Summary — L8 audience gets actions in first scroll.
[wiki-writer:Article types] COMPRESS (output_quality) → 2730w→2710w. A=0.84 B=0.85 Δ=-0.01. 40s. REVERT. Merged guide+playbook lost semantic distinction — agent selected wrong type for process doc.
[wiki-writer:Design philosophy] COMPRESS (output_quality) → 2730w→2702w. A=0.86 B=0.86 Δ=0.00. 40s. KEEP. Prose → 3-line manifesto. Zero quality loss, 50w saved.

[wiki-researcher:Research brief format] ADD (output_quality) → 1510w→1535w. A=0.89 B=0.81 Δ=+0.08. 45s. KEEP. Added Confidence assessment section between Context map and Suggested structure. Writer inherits calibrated confidence levels.
[wiki-researcher:Research principles] REWORD (output_quality) → 1535w→1548w. A=0.88 B=0.79 Δ=+0.09. 40s. KEEP. Structured citation format [source: type, date, confidence]. Enables programmatic source filtering.
[wiki-critic:Score on 5 dimensions] REWORD (output_quality) → 2131w→2310w. A=0.87 B=0.81 Δ=+0.06. 55s. KEEP. Concrete examples at each score level (10/7/4/1) across all 5 dimensions. Anchors scoring consistency.
[wiki-critic:Economy dimension] ADD (output_quality) → 2310w→2355w. A=0.85 B=0.81 Δ=+0.04. 40s. KEEP. Verb rule for list items — noun-only items are padding.

Note: First batch on fresh DuckDB priors (tables created this run). 4/4 KEEP = 100% — expected for validated patterns on first pass. Selection bias check: all n=0 combos, so this IS exploration. Future batches will have priors to balance against. Total body: 16,190w (adaptive ceiling).

## Run 31 (2026-04-05, Sunday EOD-2 Phase 6 — Karpathy, first hook experiments)

[brain:Five Levels / Current Level Status] SPLIT (info_retrieval) → 1232w→1235w. A=1.0 B=1.0 C=0.93 Δ=0.0. 19s. KEEP. Current Level Status extracted into own subsection — independently addressable.
[nervous-system:Five Levels Position] SPLIT (info_retrieval) → 872w→874w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 14s. KEEP. Dense paragraph→3 subsections (L1 Gate Status/Gate-Breaker Candidates/Parallel Level Activity). NS×SPLIT now 3/3.
[am-triage:hook prompt] REWORD (output_quality) → 117w→131w. A=0.87 B=0.87 Δ=0.0. 45s. KEEP. Added explicit execution order numbering (1-5) and stronger approval guardrail. First hook experiment. Seeded am-triage priors.
[eod-refresh:hook prompt] REWORD (output_quality) → 111w→179w. A=0.87 B=0.86 Δ=+0.01. 48s. KEEP. Added completion criteria per phase + failure handling instruction. First output-quality delta > 0. Seeded eod-refresh priors.
[heart:Step 3 technique descriptions] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 4122w→4014w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 16s. KEEP. Stripped inline caution notes from technique list — redundant with Validated Patterns table. -108w.

[am-triage×REWORD: 1 kept / 1 total]
[eod-refresh×REWORD: 1 kept / 1 total]
[heart×REMOVE: 1 kept / 1 total]

Batch stats: 5/5 KEEP (100%). Selection bias check: 100% keep rate is high, but all 5 were n=0 combos (pure exploration) — 3 new target categories (brain, am-triage, eod-refresh), 2 validated patterns (NS×SPLIT, REMOVE on redundant rationale). First hook experiments validated output-quality eval pipeline. Next batch should force harder techniques (REMOVE on unique content, MERGE on distinct registers) to generate reverts and learn boundaries.

## 2026-04-09 EOD-Backend
- Phase 1: 3 Hedy sessions ingested (Austin offsite Apr 8): OP1 brainstorm (96min, 6 action items), Adobe bi-weekly (1060min, platform health 64%), LP Testing review (33min, 3 action items). Calendar: Google Search Summit + dinner.
- Phase 2: 11 tasks completed yesterday. 2 daily resets (Today→Urgent): AU Polaris LP data, WW weblab dial-up. Reconciliation JSON written.
- Phase 3: Compression audit — 35,816w total body. No signals. Workflow health clean. Organ cascade skipped (<48h).
- Phase 4: Created ops.recurring_task_state table (8 rows: goal_updater, meta_calibration_priors, meta_calibration_projections, coherence_audit, weekly_scorecard, context_surface_refresh, agent_bridge_sync, wiki_lint). 0 tasks due today. Next due: weekly_scorecard + agent_bridge_sync on Fri 4/10.
- Phase 5: Git synced (76834c5). MotherDuck snapshot failed (plan limitation). Changelog updated.
- Phase 6: Skipped — Austin offsite context, Karpathy experiments deferred.
- Phase 7: eod-reconciliation.json + eod-maintenance.json written.

## 2026-04-20 (Monday PT, EOD) — Low-activity EOD run

**Day summary:** 14 Asana tasks closed (5 genuine + 9 bulk-cleanup backlog purge). 6 Today→Urgent demotions. Zero meetings. No Hedy sessions. One Hedy session (4/17 AI Tool Demo) remains the latest.

**Genuine completions (5):** Italy Polaris P0 ref tag revert coordination (L2, protecting OCI measurement); Refmarker mapping audit PoC for AU (L3, team automation signal, Task Progress=Done); Reply to Dwayne on Brand LP consolidated feedback (L2, ×2 duplicate tasks); Write back to Dwayne re AU Adobe Alignment session (L2).

**Bulk cleanup (9):** 10:38 PT mass-close including 26d-stale WW redirect task, CA Polaris CTA backlog, budget dashboard/account links ideas from Q1, ieCCP MX (Begin-Date future), "Using AI for paid search" research task, goal updaters. Low-friction housekeeping — not work product.

**Five Levels:** L1=0 (22 workdays streak), L2=3, L3=1, L4=0, L5=0. Testing Approach v5 still not sent — send step is the only remaining blocker, PUBLISH verdict already given (8.4/10).

**Pattern trajectory (NS Loop 3):** L1 streak STUCK → WORSENING. Brandon/Kate meeting cancellation on 4/16 removed the external forcing function. No substitute structural intervention has taken hold. Intervention proposal: decouple "send" as atomic task from any Testing Approach work block.

**Delegation failures (NS Loop 4):** Vijeth footer (32d) and Andes data (35d) both moved SLIPPING → FAILED. Both have stopped delivering — need escalation or workaround.

**Observability:** Pre-existing gap — `main.workflow_executions` was empty, `main.daily_tracker` + `main.l1_streak` did not exist. Created missing tables and backfilled today's run. The hooks/protocols have been declaring inserts that never happened. Flag for ops review.

**Body mass:** 26,734w / 14 organs. Within budget. No compression signals.

**Items logged:** daily_tracker, l1_streak, workflow_executions, autoresearch_organ_health (14 rows). Audit log appended with 6 daily_reset entries.

## 2026-04-20 (late Monday PT) — Hard-thing selection redesigned

**Richard's trigger:** Rejected Testing Approach (cancelled meeting = not avoidance) and AEO POV (constructed/artificial) as hard things. Pointed out the design flaw: hard-thing selection was top-down from the task queue, which manufactures targets when no real hard thing exists. Reframed to bottom-up signal convergence — the gap between "signals converging on a topic" and "Richard produced a referenceable artifact on it."

**What changed:**
- `body/amcc.md` — "The Hard Thing Queue" section replaced with "The Hard Thing" signal-driven model. Streak, resistance taxonomy, escalation ladder, political awareness — all unchanged. Only selection logic changed.
- `body/body-diagram.md` — aMCC node now references `main.hard_thing_now` and `main.l1_streak` instead of hardcoded state.
- `context/protocols/hard-thing-selection.md` — new protocol file (promoted from staging). Executable SQL, 7-day window, exponential half-life decay (3.5d default), incumbent advantage (1.15× margin), null-state allowed, artifact detection rules.
- `tools/scripts/hard-thing-refresh.py` — new script. Handles MotherDuck connection, throttle, stickiness, null-state fallback. Exit codes: 0=success, 1=throttled, 2=degraded (token missing or --local).
- DuckDB: created `main.hard_thing_candidates`, `main.hard_thing_topic_levels` (seeded with 10 canonical topics mapped to L1-L5), `main.hard_thing_artifact_log`, and view `main.hard_thing_now`.
- Experiment queue: filed `amcc-halflife-v1` (shadow-eval half-life at 2.0 / 3.5 / 7.0 over 14 days) as `pending` in `autoresearch_experiments`.

**Defaults Richard confirmed:** 7-day window, artifact = referenceable by non-Richard actor, top 3, continuous refresh on signal-write, stickiness via incumbent margin, signal decay as exponential half-life (not cliff).

**Current state:** `main.hard_thing_now` returns null-state with reason `null-state-local-mode-no-signals-schema` — this shell has no MotherDuck token, so the first real scoring refresh is deferred to the next token-connected run (next scheduled AM or EOD hook, or manual `python3 ~/shared/tools/scripts/hard-thing-refresh.py` with token).

**What didn't change:** streak mechanics, resistance taxonomy, escalation ladder, political awareness layer, integration with other organs. Net complexity: 3 new tables, 1 new protocol, 1 new script, 1 removed subsection from amcc.md. Trends simpler long-term because no more manual "what's the hard thing?" decisions.

**Staging folder** at `context/staged/hard-thing-redesign/` kept as-is for audit trail — README there has the full promotion checklist and today's rejection test (which polaris-brand-lp passed under validation against live MotherDuck signals during staging).


## 2026-04-21 EOD (Tuesday PT)

**Meetings (3):** Weekly Paid Acq Sync (77min), MX Paid Search/IECCP Sync (34min), Brandon 1:1 (4min TRUNCATED — laptop issue). All ingested to hedy_meetings + meeting_analytics + meeting_highlights in DuckDB.

**Asana (10 writes):**
- 7 completions reconciled (all completed 17:16-17:31 PT yesterday but missed by 4/20 EOD due to sync timing). Major shipped: Dwayne Brand LP reply (full 7-ask draft), Dwayne AU PS reply, Polaris template forward, OFA invoice, AU genbi max-clicks, BrowserStack for Adi.
- 3 daily-reset Today→Urgent demotions: W15 WBR, AU handover max-clicks check, Email overlay (Brandon ask). Kiro_RW + Next-action written on each.
- Testing Doc for Kate (hard thing): new story comment + Kiro_RW update reflecting truncated Brandon 1:1 = no send, 23 workdays at zero L1.

**New tasks (4):** Richard created MCS-2553 LP audit + Adobe dashboard template tasks (defensive pre-launch scope protection). Measure EM impact (PS ENG). Monday EU SSR auto-recurring for 4/27.

**Open blockers (2 escalations active from 4/20):** Vijeth MX Auto footer 33d, Andes Kingpin MX 36d.

**Five Levels today:** L1=0 (23rd straight workday). L2=4. L3=2. L4=0. L5=0.

**Observability:** hook_executions row written. Asana sync gap identified - DuckDB is 5+ hours stale relative to live Asana by EOD. Filed as medium-severity flag. AM hooks still not logging to DuckDB - flagged.

**Experiments:** SKIPPED (Karpathy defer pattern - needs automated hook run). 3 suggestions logged: atomic SEND task for Testing Doc, Brandon 1:1 pre-load prep block, EOD force Asana sync before reconciliation.

**Key decisions pending:**
- IECCP target 70% vs 75% for MX (confirm w/ Brandon tomorrow, gates May R&O transfer)
- Testing Approach v5 send (23 workdays stuck — apply 5 fixes + hit send, 10-min task)
- MX R&O reallocation email to Lorena (Brandon-assigned today)

**Streak:** 1 → 0 (reset). 23 workdays at zero L1. Brandon 1:1 window was the forcing function — lost to laptop.

- **Learning:** Eval agent inline prompts must stay under ~3KB for reliable behavior. Auto-loaded steering files (inclusion: auto/always) dominate agent context when inline prompts are larger. Added this constraint to heart.md Architecture section.
- **Keep rate: 100% (10/10).** Above healthy 50% threshold — indicates selection bias toward safe techniques. Next batch should force more exploration of untested combos and bolder experiments.

SPLIT that removes inline labels reverts (slack -0.2 — lost "To [person]" framing). MERGE on roster sections 2+3 kept despite anti-pattern warning — the merged table was more addressable than separate sections.

## 2026-04-22 — Karpathy Phase 6 experiment blocked (tool failure)

[richard-style-email:Email (Analytical / Update)] ADD (output_quality) → 818w→(would-be 999w). A=- B=- C=- Δ=-. BLOCKER. invokeSubAgent unavailable → all three eval agents failed with `registerSubAgentExecution is not a function`. File reverted to 818w. Priors NOT updated (blocker, not revert). Hypothesis was concrete-example + Common-Failures table — both validated winning patterns. Retry when subagent path is restored. See `~/shared/context/active/experiment-results-latest.json` and `~/shared/context/experiments/experiment-log.tsv`.
