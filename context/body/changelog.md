# Changelog — Body System

## Run 27 (2026-04-04, Randomized Batch 2 — Karpathy inline, 10 experiments: SPLIT/REMOVE/REWORD/COMPRESS/MERGE/RESTRUCTURE)

[wiki-writer:Dual-audience] SPLIT (output_quality) → 2778w→2782w. Δ=0.0. KEEP. Split "For humans" / "For agents" into subsections with ### headers.
[wiki-writer:What you don't do] REMOVE (output_quality) → 2782w→2740w. Δ=-0.3. REVERT. Negative constraints prevent scope creep — load-bearing behavioral boundaries.
[wiki-editor:Kill criteria] REWORD (output_quality) → 2214w→2214w. Δ=+0.02. KEEP. 30d→14d kill threshold. Aligns with subtraction-before-addition.
[wiki-editor:Pipeline execution] COMPRESS (output_quality) → 2214w→2180w. Δ=-0.15. REVERT. Merging handoff steps obscures checkpoint pattern — pipeline integrity depends on explicit stages.
[wiki-researcher:ABPS Asana section] SPLIT (output_quality) → 1548w→1548w. Δ=0.0. KEEP. No content change — structural header hierarchy improvement.
[wiki-critic:Design philosophy] REMOVE (output_quality) → 2539w→2490w. Δ=0.0. KEEP. 2 paragraphs of motivation → 1 line. Rubric is self-contained without framing prose.
[richard-style-email:Stakeholder Management] MERGE (output_quality) → 552w→520w. Δ=-0.08. REVERT. Stakeholder Management is a distinct register (political subtext, numbered responses). Same lesson as guide/playbook merge — don't merge distinct registers.
[richard-style-slack:Communication Gaps] REMOVE (output_quality) → 1070w→980w. Δ=-0.12. REVERT. Behavioral correction layer — agent uses gaps to compensate for Richard's known patterns (unsent messages, bilateral comms).
[richard-style-docs:Post-Mortem] RESTRUCTURE (output_quality) → 659w→665w. Δ=+0.03. KEEP. Lessons-first ordering matches "lead with the result" principle.
[richard-style-wbr:Structure template] SPLIT (output_quality) → 564w→580w. Δ=-0.05. REVERT. YoY context is NOT optional — present in every actual callout example. Labeling it "optional" degrades quality.

5 KEEP, 5 REVERT. Combined with Run 26: 10/20 KEEP, 10/20 REVERT (50% revert rate — exactly the target for randomized exploration).

Key findings:
- REMOVE on behavioral constraints (What you don't do, Communication Gaps) always reverts — these are load-bearing guardrails.
- MERGE on distinct registers (Stakeholder vs Analytical, guide vs playbook) always reverts — register distinctions are real semantic boundaries.
- SPLIT on structural organization (headers, subsections) always keeps — reorganization preserves content.
- COMPRESS on explicit handoff steps reverts — pipeline integrity depends on checkpoint granularity.
- REMOVE on motivational prose (Design philosophy) keeps — rubrics work without framing.

## Run 26 (2026-04-04, Randomized Batch 1 — Karpathy, 10 experiments, underexplored techniques: REMOVE/SPLIT/MERGE/RESTRUCTURE)

[gut:Excretion Protocol] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 2113w→1920w. A=0.125 B=1.0 Δ=-0.875. 40s. REVERT. Archive rules, delete rules, never-delete list are unique to this section — load-bearing.
[amcc:Avoidance Ratio] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 2090w→1960w. A=0.5 B=1.0 Δ=-0.5. 35s. REVERT. Empty table still defines measurement framework and formula — structural, not dead weight.
[amcc:Growth Model] SPLIT (info_retrieval) → 2090w→2090w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 30s. KEEP. Split into Growth Signals (prose) + Growth Metrics (table) subsections.
[memory:Reference Index] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 1738w→1580w. A=0.5 B=1.0 C=0.3 Δ=-0.5. 45s. REVERT. Unique folder URLs and item counts not duplicated in Key Quip Docs. Brandon she/her ✅.
[heart:Design Choices] COMPRESS (info_retrieval) → 3461w→3197w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 35s. KEEP. 15 bullets→7 by merging related points. 264w saved, zero accuracy loss.
[heart:DuckDB Integration] RESTRUCTURE (info_retrieval) → 3197w→3198w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 30s. KEEP. Update Protocol moved first (actionable), Key Queries moved to end (reference).
[nervous-system:Loop 3 Pattern table] MERGE (info_retrieval) → 928w→859w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 30s. KEEP. 6-row table→2 summary lines with explicit root cause. 69w saved.
[device:Agent Bridge] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 1242w→1150w. A=0.0 B=1.0 Δ=-1.0. 35s. REVERT. Unique operational IDs (spreadsheet, service account, creds path) only source of truth.
[device:Tool Factory] RESTRUCTURE (info_retrieval) → 1242w→1242w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 30s. KEEP. Status-first ordering: ✅ BUILT → Ready to build → Backlog.
[brain:OP1 Strategic Narrative] REMOVE (info_retrieval) → 1257w→1210w. A=0.375 B=1.0 C=0.2 Δ=-0.625. 40s. REVERT. 5 workstream names, core argument, file path not in D8. Brain safety: INCORRECT triggered.

[brain×REMOVE: 0 kept / 2 total]

Key findings: 5/10 KEEP, 5/10 REVERT — exactly the 50% revert rate predicted for underexplored techniques. ALL 5 REMOVE experiments REVERTED. Pattern: REMOVE fails when the section contains unique content (IDs, URLs, rules, formulas) not duplicated elsewhere. REMOVE succeeds only when content is truly redundant across organs. SPLIT, MERGE, RESTRUCTURE, and COMPRESS all KEPT — structural changes preserve information while improving organization. Heart Design Choices COMPRESS saved 264w (15→7 bullets) — largest single-experiment word savings this run. The "empty table" hypothesis (amcc Avoidance Ratio) disproven: empty structural tables define measurement frameworks even without data. Brain OP1 REMOVE confirmed: even 3-line sections can be load-bearing if they contain unique facts (workstream names).

Key findings: 10/10 KEEP — second consecutive perfect batch. Info-retrieval experiments all Δ=0.0 (accuracy preserved, brain compressed 188w with zero loss). Output-quality experiments averaged Δ=+0.07 across 6 wiki agent experiments. First experiments on wiki-librarian, wiki-concierge, heart, and body — all KEEP.

[richard-style-docs:Universal Rules] ADD (output_quality) → 579w→619w. A=0.87 B=0.84 Δ=+0.03. 50s. KEEP. 3-bullet max + verb-start rule constrains list bloat.
[richard-style-amazon:Analytical Patterns metric rule] REWORD (output_quality) → 351w→373w. A=0.87 B=0.82 Δ=+0.05. 55s. KEEP. Metric template: [metric][value]([comparison],[interpretation]).

Key finding: guide/playbook MERGE reverted on BOTH wiki-writer (Run 21) and wiki-editor (Run 23). The distinction is validated — DO vs FOLLOW is a real semantic boundary for the pipeline. Confidence calibration table (+0.06) was the highest-yield experiment — explicit criteria eliminate vague hedging.

## Run 20 (2026-04-04, Saturday batch 2 — Karpathy)

[device:Templates + Device Health] COMPRESS (info_retrieval) → 1307w→1240w. A=1.0 B=1.0 Δ=0.0. 35s. KEEP. Removed empty Templates section, compressed Device Health table (4-col→3-col, merged function names).

[wiki-writer:Voice rules] ADD (output_quality) → 2698w→2718w. A=0.88 B=0.86 Δ=+0.02. 45s. KEEP. Added "so what" test rule — marginal economy improvement.
[wiki-writer:Draft structure template] RESTRUCTURE (output_quality) → 2718w→2730w. A=0.84 B=0.83 Δ=+0.01. 50s. KEEP. Moved Next Steps after Exec Summary — L8 audience gets actions in first scroll.
[wiki-writer:Article types] COMPRESS (output_quality) → 2730w→2710w. A=0.84 B=0.85 Δ=-0.01. 40s. REVERT. Merged guide+playbook lost semantic distinction — agent selected wrong type for process doc.
[wiki-writer:Design philosophy] COMPRESS (output_quality) → 2730w→2702w. A=0.86 B=0.86 Δ=0.00. 40s. KEEP. Prose → 3-line manifesto. Zero quality loss, 50w saved.

[wiki-critic:Score on 5 dimensions] REWORD (output_quality) → 2131w→2310w. A=0.87 B=0.81 Δ=+0.06. 55s. KEEP. Concrete examples at each score level (10/7/4/1) across all 5 dimensions. Anchors scoring consistency.
[wiki-critic:Economy dimension] ADD (output_quality) → 2310w→2355w. A=0.85 B=0.81 Δ=+0.04. 40s. KEEP. Verb rule for list items — noun-only items are padding.
