# Hands — Execution & Tooling

*What gets done and how. Active tasks, dependencies, integrations, hooks, and the systems that turn decisions into action. The canonical action tracker.*

*Operating principle: Reduce decisions, not options. Every task should have a clear next action, a pre-written draft if it involves communication, and a due date that drives My Day. Richard opens his list and acts — he doesn't plan.*

## Hook System (daily execution)

| # | Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|---------|
| AM-1 | Ingest (`am-1-ingest`) | userTriggered | Slack scan + Asana sync + email scan → intake files |
| AM-2 | Triage + Draft (`am-2-triage`) | userTriggered | Process intake → update tasks + draft replies |
| AM-3 | Brief + Blocks (`am-3-brief`) | userTriggered | Daily brief + Slack posts + dashboard + calendar blocks |
| EOD-1 | Meeting Sync (`eod-1-meeting-sync`) | userTriggered | Hedy + Outlook → meetings/ series files |
| EOD-2 | System Refresh (`eod-2-system-refresh`) | userTriggered | Maintenance cascade + experiments + git sync |
| 1 | WBR: Weekly Callouts (`wbr-callouts`) | userTriggered | Full 10-market callout pipeline |
| 2 | Sync to SharePoint (`sharepoint-sync`) | userTriggered | Wiki → SharePoint via OneDrive |
| 3 | PS Audit (`ps-audit`) | userTriggered | Paid search audit pipeline |
| 4 | Agent Bridge Sync (`agent-bridge-sync`) | userTriggered | Sync portable-body/ to GitHub |
| — | Guard: Email | preToolUse | Blocks email send unless only recipient is prichwil |
| — | Guard: Calendar | preToolUse | Blocks calendar events with external attendees |

**AM-1→2→3 is the daily driver.** EOD-1→2 runs after meetings. Each hook loads only what it needs — failure is isolated.
